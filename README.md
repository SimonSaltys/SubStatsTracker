# SubStatsTracker

Interfaces with the mpv extension [MPVacious](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious) to display subtitles from currently playing content. Its main use is to easily see subtitles in the target language you are currently learning. 

The intended language this app supports is Japanese. Use this site in conjuction with [YomiTan](https://yomitan.wiki/) to easily look up the subtitles in the dictonary.
